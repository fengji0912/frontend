        <h2>Privacy statement</h2>
        <p>
          Data protection is of high priority for the Technische
          Informationsbibliothek (TIB). Using the Open Research Knowledge Graph
          does not require the provision of any personal data. However, the
          processing of personal data may be required where a data subject wants
          to use special service features, e.g. ORKG user profiles. Where the
          processing of personal data is required and where there is no legal
          basis for such processing, we shall obtain the data subject’s consent.
        </p>
        <p>
          The processing of personal data, such as for example the data
          subject’s name, email address, or ORCID shall always be carried out in
          accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the
          state and institution-specific data protection rules and regulations
          applicable to the TIB. This privacy statement serves to inform the
          public about the nature, scope and purpose of the personal data the
          Open Research Knowledge Graph collects, uses and processes, as well as
          of the rights data subjects are entitled to.
        </p>
        <p>
          The terms used in this privacy statement are to be understood within

        <h3>Registration</h3>
        <p>
          Users may register on ORKG. When registering, ORKG collects personal
          data in order to be able to provide personalized and generally

          protection provided for the ORKG offered by the TIB.
        </p>
        <h3>Cookies</h3>
        <p>
          The ORKG service uses cookies. Cookies are text files that are placed
          and stored on a computer system via an Internet browser and serve to
          render the offer of the ORKG more user-friendly, effective and secure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most of the cookies used are so-called “session cookies”, which are
          automatically deleted at the end of the visit. Other cookies remain
          stored on the user’s terminal device until he or she deletes them.
          These cookies enable the ORKG to recognise the user’s browser on his
          or her next visit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Users can prevent and permanently object to the setting of cookies by
          the ORKG service at any time by choosing the corresponding settings of
          the Internet browser used. Furthermore, cookies already set can be
          deleted at any time with the Internet browser or by other software
          programs. This is possible in all common Internet browsers. If the
          data subject deactivates the setting of cookies in the Internet
          browser used, the ORKG service may not function properly.
        </p>
        <h3>Use of web analysis tools</h3>
        <p>
          ORKG uses the open source web analytics software Matomo (matomo.org)
          to analyse usage data in order to optimise its online offer. TIB
          self-hosts Matomo and no data is shared with third parties. Cookies
          are used to enable a statistical analysis of the use of this website
          by its visitors as well as the display of usage-related content. There
          is no other use, merging with other data or disclosure to third
          parties.
        </p>
        <strong>Matomo-Opt-Out</strong>
        <p>
          The information generated with Matomo about the use of this website is
          processed and stored exclusively with the ORKG.
        </p>
        <iframe
          title="Matomo opt-out"
          src="https://support.tib.eu/piwik/index.php?module=CoreAdminHome&amp;action=optOut&amp;language=en&amp;backgroundColor=ffffff&amp;fontColor=&amp;fontSize=14px&amp;fontFamily=%22Helvetica%20Neue%22%2CHelvetica%2CArial%2Csans-serif"
          style={{ border: 0, height: 130, width: '100%' }}
        ></iframe>
        <p>
          In this case, an opt-out cookie is placed in the browser of the data
          subject, which prevents Matomo from storing usage data. When the
          cookies are deleted, the Matomo opt-out cookie is also deleted. Such
          objection (opt-out) must be redeclared when visiting the ORKG again.
        </p>
        <h3>Collection of general data and information (logfiles)</h3>
        <p>
          Whenever a data subject calls the ORKG service, the service
          automatically collects information in so-called server log files,
          which your browser automatically transmits to the service. This is:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Browser type and browser version</li>
          <li>Operating system used</li>
          <li>Referrer URL</li>
          <li>Hostname of the accessing computer</li>
          <li>IP address</li>
          <li>Internet service provider of the accessing system</li>
          <li>Time of the server request</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          As a general rule, this data is not attributable to a particular
          person. This data will not be merged with other data sources and will
          be deleted after they have fulfilled the purpose of securing technical
          functioning of the service.
        </p>
        <h3>Chatwoot</h3>
        <p>
          To enable easy and direct communication with the service support team,
          ORKG integrates Chatwoot (chatwoot.com). To use Chatwoot data subjects
          are not required to provide personal data. Chatwoot uses cookies to
          identify users, which is required to provide the chat functionality.
          They do not sell or transfer your Personally Identifiable Information
          to third-parties or use it for other purposes. For more information,

        <h3>Twitter Plugin</h3>
        <p>
          On this website, functions of the Twitter service are integrated based
          on your consent, once you click on the button &quot;Load
          Timeline&quot;. These functions are provided by Twitter International
          Company, One Cumberland Place, Fenian Street, Dublin 2, D02 AX07,
          Ireland. By using Twitter and the &quot;Re-Tweet&quot; function, the
          websites you visit will be linked to your Twitter account and made
          known to other users. Data is also transferred to Twitter in the
          process. It is used by Twitter and, if applicable, Twitter partners
          for their own purposes. Further information on this can be found in
          the Twitter privacy policy at:{' '}

          The Twitter plugin is used on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a
          DSGVO. The website operator has a legitimate interest in the widest
          possible visibility in the social media. If the appropriate consent
          has been requested, the processing is carried out exclusively on the
          basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a DSGVO; the consent can be revoked at
          any time.

        <h3>Data sharing</h3>
        <p>
          Some ORKG services share (personal) data with third parties.
          Currently, this is the case with DataCite e.V. upon DOI-based
          publishing of ORKG comparisons. In order to mint a DataCite DOI, ORKG
          shares metadata about the comparison with DataCite. Such metadata
          include comparison creator names and ORCID, if applicable. The sharing
          of such data is based on user consent given as part of the service of
          DataCite e. V. and ORCID. Users need to connect their ORKG profile
          with ORCID and need to explicitly activate DOI-based publication of
          ORKG comparisons.
        </p>
        <h3>Routine deletion and blocking of personal data</h3>
        <p>
          The TIB processes and stores the data subject’s personal data only for
          the period necessary to achieve the purpose of such storage and in
          accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation and the country
          and institution-specific data protection regulations applicable to the
          TIB. Thereafter, the personal data will routinely be blocked or
          deleted in accordance with the statutory provisions. If the user no
          longer wishes to use the services of the TIB and in the absence of any
          claims of the TIB against the user and of any other legal basis for
          storage, we shall delete the personal data upon request.
        </p>
        <h3>Rights of the data subject</h3>
        <p>
          You shall at any time be entitled to obtain information about the data
          stored in this library, its origin and recipient and about the purpose
          of such data processing, as well as to rectification or erasure or
          restriction of processing or – to the extent that such processing is
          based on your consent – a right of withdrawal, possibly a right of
          objection and the right to data portability. Complaints may be lodged
          with the above-mentioned supervisory authority. You can contact us at
          any time for further questions on the subject of personal data.
