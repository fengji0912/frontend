        <h3>1. Scope of Application</h3>
        <p>
          1.1 These Special Conditions ORKG regulate the use of the ORKG as well
          as the rights and obligations of Registered Users and the TIB in
          addition to the Terms of Use of TIB.
        </p>
        <p>
          1.2 ORKG is primarily aimed at scholars who want to share, explore and
          reuse scholarly knowledge in a novel manner. ORKG data and software
          are freely accessible to everyone.
        </p>
        <h3>2. Registration</h3>
        <p>
          2.1 ORKG can be searched and its content can be explored and reused
          without registration.
        </p>
        <p>
          2.2 Some services, such as user profiles, linking profiles to ORCID,
          DOI-based publication of content require a registration (Registered
          Users).
        </p>
        <p>
          2.3 There is no entitlement to registration, account or profile. The
          TIB is entitled to reject registrations or terminate accounts if a
          violation of these Special Conditions ORKG exists or is expected.
        </p>
        <p>
          2.4 When registering, users must agree to the Special Conditions ORKG
          and the Data Protection Declaration. If these Special Conditions ORKG
          are updated, Registered Users will be notified of the changes two
          weeks in advance by email. By subsequently continuing to use ORKG,
          Registered Users agree to the changes.
        </p>
        <p>
          2.5 A usage relationship is established between the TIB and the
          Registered User through registration.
        </p>
        <p>
          2.6 When registering, users are obliged to fill in mandatory fields
          truthfully and completely, to keep their data up-to-date and secret
          and to protect data from access by third parties.
        </p>
        <p>
          2.7 Accounts may be terminated for cause by TIB. A cause can be a
          breach of the Terms of Use or these Special Conditions or a legal
          obligation or official order for TIB to block the access or any other
          conduct, which raises the suspicion that the user violates or will
          violate the Terms of Use, these Special Conditions or other legal
          obligations also in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          2.8 TIB will terminate accounts at the request of the user in text
          form at any time and without undue delay. All personal data in the
          user profile will be deleted without undue delay. Content created by
          users remains published as long as the TIB does not delete this
          content or the user does not request its deletion, whereupon the TIB
          will anonymise this content.
        </p>
        <h3>3. ORKG</h3>
        <p>
          3.1 Anyone can view and use ORKG content. Registered Users can create
          and modify content.
        </p>
        <p>
          3.2 The source code is made available under the
          <a href="/orkg/license">MIT License</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          3.3 Registered Users confirm that published content does not infringe
          any third party rights (e.g. copyright, rights of performers,
          personality and publicity rights, data protection). If others are
          involved in the production, Registered Users confirm that all
          participants are aware of the content of this agreement and have given
          their consent.
        </p>
        <p>
          3.4 Registered Users ensure that the published content does not
          violate applicable law or offend common decency, in particular does
          not constitute a criminal offense and does not constitute an
          administrative offense (e.g. infringement of copyright, trademark law,
          competition law) or none have offensive, discriminatory, racist,
          pornographic or extremist content. In the event of a violation,
          Section 5 applies.
        </p>
        <p>
          3.5 If a user becomes aware of a violation of the law within the
          meaning of 3.3 or 3.4 he / she is obliged to inform the TIB
          immediately.
        </p>
        <p>
          3.6 Registered Users will indemnify the TIB from all claims of other
          users or third parties that they assert against the TIB due to
          infringement of their rights through content published by the
          respective Registered User, if the respective user can be held
          responsible. The respective Registered User assumes the costs of an
          appropriate legal defense of the TIB. This does not apply if the
          Registered User is not responsible for the infringement. Users are
          obliged to provide all information necessary for the examination of
          the claims and a defense in the event of a claim against the TIB
          truthfully and completely without further delay.
        </p>
        <h3>4. Functionality of the ORKG</h3>
        <p>
          4.1 Anyone can use the ORKG service to view and use content without
          registration. ORKG content can be reused freely for any purpose users
          see fit, in accordance with the CC0 License (5.2 of these Special
          Conditions ORKG).
        </p>
        <p>
          4.2 ORKG provides functionality that requires registration. Creating
          and editing, including deleting, existing content is reserved to
          Registered Users. Content is created and edited in accordance with the
          CC0 License (5.1 of these Special Conditions ORKG). Registered Users
          obtain ORKG user profiles, can link their profile to ORCID, are
          included in provenance information, can be members of ORKG
          Observatories and can publish ORKG Comparisons with a DOI.
        </p>
        <p>
          4.3 ORKG provides programmatic access to the content (API). Anyone can
          use the ORKG API to access existing content. Creating and editing,
          including deleting, existing content via the ORKG API is reserved to
          Registered Users.
        </p>
        <p>
          4.4 ORKG enables DOI-based publication of ORKG content, in particular
          ORKG Comparisons. In doing so, metadata including creator names and,
          if known, ORCID IDs are shared with DataCite. If a Registered User
          publishes ORKG content in this form, she or he agrees to the sharing
          of metadata with DataCite. The sharing of such data is based on user
          consent given as part of the service of DataCite e. V. and ORCID.
          Registered Users need to connect their ORKG profile with ORCID and
          need to explicitly activate DOI-based publication of ORKG comparisons.
        </p>
        <p>
          4.5 TIB manually curates ORKG content, including metadata. In such
          activities, TIB also resolves personal identifiers of creators in
          order to reduce the ambiguity of personal names.
        </p>
        <h3>5. Rights and obligations of the TIB</h3>

        <p>
          5.3 The TIB assumes no liability that the service and its content are
          always uninterrupted, unchanged and available in full, as well as
          being up-to-date and free from errors of an editorial or technical

        </p>
        <p>
          5.4 The TIB reserves the right to change the functionality, the

          the changes.
        </p>
        <p>
          5.5 The TIB is entitled to terminate its service at any time. In this
          case, the TIB reserves the right to delete the content. However, this
          does not result in an obligation to delete the content.
        </p>
        <p>
          5.6 The TIB provides scientific information in all areas of
          engineering as well as chemistry, information technology, mathematics
          and physics to the public. If content by Registered Users does not
          satisfy the quality criteria TIB generally applies to scientific
          information, TIB may exclude the content from its services without
          prior notice.
        </p>
        <p>
          5.7 In principle, the TIB is only liable for damage caused by intent
          or gross negligence. In case of injuries to life, body or health
          statutory provisions apply.
        </p>
        <p>
          5.8 Liability for damage from unauthorized use of password-protected
          logins by third parties is not accepted.
        </p>
        <p>
          5.9 Insofar as liability is limited or excluded, this also applies in
          favor of executive employees (m / f), representatives (m / f) and
          vicarious agents (m / f) of the TIB.
        </p>
        <p>
          5.10 If there are concrete indications of a violation of these Special
          Conditions ORKG, the TIB is entitled to delete content, restrict the
          use of the services or block the Registered User concerned. When
          choosing a measure, the legitimate interests of the Registered User
          are taken into account, in particular whether there are indications
          that the Registered User was not responsible for the violation.
        </p>
        <p>
          5.11 Content that contains a legal violation according to 3.3 or 3.4
          may be blocked or deleted by the TIB.
